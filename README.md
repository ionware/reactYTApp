# Here's my first ReactApp
Religiously following [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider) React course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/); Here's what We cooked up during the
course. It's quite fun tho, And I am gradually falling in love with Javascript Frameworks.

Maybe it's time to move away from `PHP`? Subsequent courses will tell!

### Setting Up
Most of the enviroment set up is done by the tutor(FYI: this is a boilerplate). Simply go over this:

- Basically after cloning this `REPO`, update the `src/config/config.js` file and include your Youtube API Key.

- Run `npm install` in the repository's root folder. Finale!
